# NASP_Team
This is the working files for our project SnapSoccer developed by Parth Patel and I Nazib Rahman. 
We followed the project brief to the best of our ability and implemented design choices through our Analysts (Shah Chisti and Alamin Uddin) 
We created 10 team home pages that were split between Parth Patel and I (Nazib Rahman)
We created Player profiles inside of the team page displaying 2 players of each team. 
We made a comments section underneath the player bios for users to submit. 
All of the files are working correctly and runs all pages which can be navigated thrpugh.
